<p class="heading2">Purpose of the game:</p>
<p class="regtext">Our program will calculate the flow of money of a user as a lot of people do not keep track of their daily expenses and their income/s.
The user gets their daily report with the stats provided, in order to maintain their over expense and manage money. </p>
<p class="regtext">People’s budgeting skills are detrimental to their future. That's why we plan to teach our users
ways to better manage their money. Following a budget or spending plan will also keep our wusers out of debt and will 
help them work out any debt they currently have.
</p>

<br/><br/>

<p class="heading2">Our Goal:</p>
<p class="regtext">The main reason behind us creating this application is to help find a way to help people budget but
we want to make it feel fun so it does not feel like a chore to our users. Nowadays nearly 3 out of 5 Americans struggle managing money. 
This is where our application comes in and helps with that. </p>
